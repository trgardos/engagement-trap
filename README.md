# About this survey paper

This is a survey paper initially generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5 from the following prompt:

**Prompt:**

> I'm giving lectures on recommendation systems in a graduate data science class. I want to talk about societal impacts of recommendation systems, especially those that are tuned to maximize engagement rather than necessarily show you the best and most appropriate content. Do a literature search on recommendation algorithms at popuplar sites like Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube and Facebook. Put together a short survey paper and then a short presentation in markdown format where slides are separated by 2nd level markdown headings. Cite all references in the survey paper and overview presentation.

To process the latex, use the [Latex Workshop](https://open-vsx.org/extension/James-Yu/latex-workshop) extension for VS Code. Follow the setup instructions in the extension.
