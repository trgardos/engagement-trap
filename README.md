**Prompt:**

> I'm giving lectures on recommendation systems in a graduate data science class. I want to talk about societal impacts of recommendation systems, especially those that are tuned to maximize engagement rather than necessarily show you the best and most appropriate content. Do a literature search on recommendation algorithms at popuplar sites like Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube and Facebook. Put together a short survey paper and then a short presentation in markdown format where slides are separated by 2nd level markdown headings. Cite all references in the survey paper and overview presentation.
